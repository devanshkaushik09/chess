Welcome to my Chess Game project!
<br>
As a passionate chess enthusiast, I recently found myself drawn deeper into the game. Inspired by the strategic complexities and timeless appeal of chess, Iâ€™ve decided to challenge myself by building a fully functional chess game using Python.
<br>

This project aims to recreate the classic chessboard and its intricate rules, allowing players to enjoy a full chess experience directly from their computer.
<br>

Project Overview
<br>
This chess game will feature:
<br>

-->Classic 8x8 Chessboard: Standard setup with pieces including pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, queens, and kings.
<br>
-->Turn-Based Play: White and black alternate turns until checkmate, stalemate, or draw.
<br>
-->Legal Move Validation: Ensures all moves are valid based on chess rules.
<br>
-->Check and Checkmate Detection: Automatically checks for checks and checkmates.
<br>
-->Customizable Features: Future additions may include multiplayer mode, AI opponents, and enhanced visuals.
<br>
<br>
#Technologies Used
<br>
Language: Python
<br>
Libraries:
<br>
  pygame (for game graphics and rendering)
<br>

Roadmap
<br>
 -->Initial setup and basic piece movements
<br>
 -->Implement check and checkmate logic
<br>
 -->Add support for castling and en passant
<br>
 -->Create AI opponent using Minimax or other algorithms
<br>
 -->Add a polished user interface and animations
<br>
